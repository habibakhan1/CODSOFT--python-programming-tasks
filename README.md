# CODSOFT -python-programming-tasks
This repository contains the Python tasks I completed during my internship at CodSoft. Each task is designed to enhance basic programming skills, focusing on problem-solving, algorithm implementation, and real-world applications.
1. Rock, Paper, Scissors Game 🎮
This is a simple implementation of the Rock, Paper, Scissors game where the player competes against the computer. The computer's choice is randomly generated, and the game determines the winner based on standard rules. It was a great way for me to practice conditionals, loops, and working with user input.

2. Password Generator 🔐
In this project, I built a password generator that creates secure, randomized passwords. The user can set the desired length, and the program generates a password containing letters, numbers, and special characters. It also checks to ensure the password has at least two digits and one special character for added security. This project allowed me to explore string manipulation and random functions in Python.

3. Calculator 🧮
This is a basic calculator that can perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The user inputs two numbers and selects the operation, and the program outputs the result. This project helped me practice handling user input, working with mathematical operations, and building simple logic structures.
